Writing discipline (2015-07-18)
===

I need discipline to write regularly. I need to stop thinking that there is anything to be gained by spending a lot of time contemplating writing. The more I write the more ideas I can get down and the better I get at getting down ideas. I still sympathise with the idea that by sitting back and taking stock of what I'm going to write I gain structure, and it's true, but what I really need at the moment is to create a lot of material. Not only can structure come later but it is actually really not that important at the moment. I'm not writing a book, or doing a presentation.

So the discipline I need is to write regularly. Like every week? Or every day? I wonder if I could do it every day. I could make myself write something every train journey - that could work - but the problem is that I don't necessarily take trains regularly. Most weeks it'll be twice a week, but then some weeks I don't go to London at all.

Do I also need a mechanism for making sure I continue one piece of writing until it's finished? If I just get to choose what to write during each writing session I would just pick the thing at the top of my head, write until I ran out of time or got bored, and then stop with a half-finished piece and never come back to it. So I think I do need such a mechanism. Maybe I can put pieces of writing in a backlog, or maybe give them a scoring and weighting mechanism.

Another thought - I could have an editing session. A session set aside for just finishing off, tidying up and publishing articles. I should probably have one for my blog and one for work. Maybe if I have this session then I don't need a mechanism for making sure I stay on track with previous writing? Or I'll keep the staying on track idea on the back-burner and see how I get on.

I think it's time for an actionable items list:

- Choose a time for writing - probably a train ride or two, maybe when going back from London in the evening?
- Block out a morning at work - once per week - for polishing off and publishing a new blog post. If I can publish a new blog post for work every week that would just be incredible.
- Block out an hour or two at the weekend for publishing a blog post to robinwinslow.co.uk. Once again, one blog post a week would be amazing - no matter what the quality.

I just thought of something else. As well as being disciplined about writing often, I need to be disciplined about improving my skills. Referencing well is something I do naturally [citation needed], but I need better mechanisms for making sure I store good sources for future use. I can adopt some best practices right now:

- Always bookmark interesting looking pages in Chrome - maybe add "reference" keyword to the descriptions
- Use implicit reference-style [Markdown links][] (`[link text][]` and `[link text]: {url} "{description}"`) to preserve as much information as possible about the reference - in case the link breaks.
- Keep trying to learn better skills

For this final point, I think I need to go on a course to learn a bunch of things I'm not necessarily that good at:

- Sticking to the point
- Knowing when I'm using a biased or leading voice
- Rhetorical devices for engaging the reader
- Ethical treatment of my subject

To this end, I think I should find a course or two so I can learn to write better.
